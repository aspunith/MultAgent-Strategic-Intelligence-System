# Acme Corp Q3 2025 Financial Report

## Revenue Performance
Acme Corp reported Q3 2025 revenue of $2.3 billion, representing a 12% year-over-year increase from $2.05 billion in Q3 2024. The growth was primarily driven by expansion in the cloud services division, which grew 28% to $890 million.

## Operating Margins
Operating margins improved to 18.5%, up from 16.2% in the prior year quarter. The improvement was attributed to cost optimization initiatives in the supply chain and reduced headcount in non-core divisions.

## Cloud Services Division
The cloud services division now accounts for 38.7% of total revenue, up from 33.9% a year ago. Customer retention rates remained strong at 94.2%, with net revenue retention at 118%.

## Challenges
The hardware division continued to face headwinds, with revenue declining 8% year-over-year to $520 million. Management cited increased competition from Asian manufacturers and supply chain disruptions.

## Outlook
Management raised full-year guidance to $9.0-9.2 billion in revenue, up from the previous estimate of $8.7-8.9 billion. This implies Q4 revenue of approximately $2.4-2.6 billion.

## Risk Factors
- Regulatory scrutiny in the EU market may impact cloud pricing strategies
- Foreign exchange headwinds estimated at $45 million impact for Q4
- Key customer concentration: top 10 customers represent 32% of revenue
