# Acme Corp Strategic Review - Board Memo (Confidential)

## Executive Assessment
Following our Q3 results and market positioning review, the board should consider the following strategic options for the next 12-18 months.

## Option A: Double Down on Cloud
- Increase cloud R&D to 20% of division revenue ($178M annual)
- Expand to Europe (Frankfurt, London data centers) by Q2 2026
- Target: grow cloud market share from 4.2% to 6% by end of 2026
- Risk: $300M+ capital expenditure; ROI uncertain within 2 years
- Note: This CONTRADICTS the cost optimization strategy that improved margins

## Option B: Strategic Partnership
- Partner with a hyperscaler (Azure or Google Cloud) for infrastructure
- Focus Acme's resources on application layer and vertical solutions
- Lower capital requirements ($50-80M)
- Risk: loss of differentiation; dependency on partner pricing

## Option C: Explore Acquisition Interest
- Multiple parties have expressed informal interest
- Estimated valuation range: $18-24 billion (8-10x cloud revenue)
- Would provide shareholder premium of 35-50% over current market cap
- Risk: regulatory approval timeline; employee retention concerns

## Board Recommendation
Management recommends Option A with a fallback to Option B if Q4 cloud growth decelerates below 20%. Option C should remain on the table for further discussion in the February 2026 board meeting.

## Contradictory Note
Internal analysis from the CTO office suggests cloud growth may NOT be sustainable at 28% — their model predicts a deceleration to 18-20% by Q2 2026 as enterprise migration deals complete. This conflicts with the optimistic revenue guidance raised by the CFO.
